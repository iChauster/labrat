A total of 72 middle-aged (40 - 60 years of age) healthy and hypertensive men and women will participate in these protocols after providing written informed consent.
The investigators aim to include a 1 to 1 ratio of females and males in each group.
Individuals diagnosed or presenting with stage 1 and stage 2 hypertension (range 140/90 to 179/109 mmHg, according to the seventh report of the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation, and Treatment of High BP) may be eligible for this study.

Blood pressure status will be assessed in triplicate in the laboratory during the medical exam and during a 24 hour period using ambulatory blood pressure monitoring.

Both methods must confer hypertension for study enrollment.



Other than hypertension, all hypertensive patients will be otherwise healthy and free of overt disease as assessed by:

medical history;
standard blood chemistries (chem. 7 panel),
ECG at rest;
limb vascular examination (ankle-brachial BP index > 0.9);
resting BP > 140/90 mmHg; and
skinfold % body fat assessment.


Subjects will have a body mass index (BMI) between 19 and 30 and have plasma glucose concentrations < 7.0 mmol/L under fasting conditions and < 11.1 mmol/L at 120 minutes of an oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT), as defined by the American Diabetes Association.

To reduce heterogeneity of the hypertensive subjects while maintaining a ""real world"" approach the following classes of drugs will be allowed;

diuretics,
angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors,
and angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARB).


Healthy normotensive subjects will be matched to their hypertensive counterparts and will be free from overt cardiovascular disease according to the criteria described above.

Hypertensive subjects must exhibit a 10 mmHg or greater increase in MAP at 25% of their workrate maximum during knee extension exercise to be included in this study.
Established criteria defining a cut off for an ""exaggerated"" exercise pressor reflex does not exist.
Therefore, the investigators have set the operational definition at a 10 mmHg or greater increase in MAP during 25% of workrate maximum knee extensor exercise.
This 10 mmHg increase in MAP was chosen as this value closely matches the investigators' preliminary data (Figure 1) and previous reports while concomitantly corresponding to an increase in BP that is at least 2 standard deviations greater than the normotensive response (i.e. 6 2 (SD) mmHg increase in MAP at 25% of their workrate maximum).
The magnitude of the exercise-induced increase in MAP will be determined during preliminary testing.
It should be noted that the magnitude of the pressor response is graded in relation to exercise intensity, therefore, by establishing an inclusion criterion of 10 mmHg at 25% of workrate maximum, the lowest intensity to be used in the proposed studies, the investigators have set a conservative standard for study enrollment.
","
Candidates demonstrating dyslipidemia based on the National Cholesterol Education Program Guidelines of plasma total cholesterol > 240 mg/dl with LDL-cholesterol > 160 mg/dl will be excluded from participation.
Hypertensive patients receiving dual or monotherapy treatment for hypertension may be included.
Less frequently prescribed classes of drugs for hypertension (beta blockers, aldosterone receptor blocker, centrally acting sympatholytics, calcium channel blocker, direct vasodilators, renin inhibitors, and alpha blockers) will be excluded.
Additionally, subjects reporting a history of myocardial infarction, unstable cardiac ischemia, recent cardiac catheterization, carotid artery disease, transient ischemic attack will be excluded.
Participants must have no orthopedic limitations that would prohibit them from knee-extensor exercise or aerobic activity including cycle ergometry or treadmill exercise.
Due to the age requirement of the subjects women may be either pre or post-menopausal.
All pre-menopausal women will be studied during days 1 - 7 of their menstrual cycle to standardize the influence of female hormones.
Women taking hormone replacement therapy (HRT) currently or in the preceding year will be excluded from the proposed studies due to the direct vascular effects of HRT and the variety of regimes employed.
Participants will be made up of primarily Veterans.

Greater than or equal to 35 years of age and less than or equal to 60 years of age. Middle aged adults have the highest prevalence of short sleep compared to other stages of adulthood.
Objectively confirmed MetS defined by three or more of the following: a) waist circumference greater than 120cm (men) or 88cm (women), b) blood pressure greater than or equal to 135 mmHg systolic or greater than or equal to 85 mmHg diastolic or antihypertensive medication use, c) fasting glucose greater than or equal to 110 mg/dL or insulin or oral hypoglycemic medication use, d) serum triglycerides greater than or equal to 150mg/dL or hypertriglyceride medication use, e) HDL-c less than 40mg/dL (women) or less than 50 mg/dL (men) or medication use for low HDL-c1. MetS was selected because individuals with MetS are at high risk for multiple chronic conditions.
Accelerometry confirmed short sleep (average work day sleep less than or equal to 6.5 hours/night). Self-reported sleep may overestimate sleep duration. This will ensure that participants will have short sleep patterns that are associated with MetS outcomes.
English speaking. Participants will need to demonstrate adequate English comprehension (assessed during informed consent).
","
Pregnancy/lactation (self-reported). Pregnancy and lactation can disrupt habitual sleep patterns, and hormonal changes during pregnancy increase insulin resistance and may confound MetS.
Current chemotherapy treatments (self-reported). Current chemotherapy treatments may contribute to fatigue and sleep disturbances.
Alcohol abuse/dependence will be assessed with the Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test (a measure that has demonstrated good reliability and validity). Alcohol abuse/dependence may contribute to sleep disturbances and limit the participant's ability to take part in sleep interventions.
Night shift or shift work (previous 2 months), trans-meridian travel (previous 4 weeks), or planned shift work or trans-meridian travel during intervention period (self-reported). These will be to ensure that sleep estimates from baseline represent participants' habitual sleep and to ensure adherence with the sleep intervention.
Moderate-severe or severe depression will be assessed with the PHQ-9. Moderate-severe depression or severe depression may contribute to sleep disturbances and interfere with the participant's ability to adhere to the sleep interventions.
Chronic use of sleep-promoting medications (self-reported). These may interfere with sleep patterns and limit the participant's ability to take part in the sleep interventions.
Habitual napping, defined as 2 naps per day or > 90 minutes of napping on 3 or more days of the week will be assessed during baseline with accelerometry. This will be to ensure adherence with the sleep intervention.

Male and female subjects over 3 years of age with no upper limit for age (with the exception of the Down syndrome group see below). Currently meet criteria for at least one of the following:

DSM-IV (or other approved) criteria for one of the following clinical diagnoses: Multi-Dimensionally Impaired, Obsessive Compulsive Disorder, Childhood Onset Schizophrenia, Turner Syndrome, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Asperger Syndrome, High Functioning Autism, Pervasive Development Disorder
Sex chromosome aneuploidy as determined by karyotype (including XXX, XXXX, XXXXX, XXY, XXYY, XXXY, XXXXY, XYY).

Newly enrolled adults and minors once they become adults over age 18 who cannot give consent due to limited capacity may have a surrogate, i.e., a legally responsible representative (LAR), sign the consent. LARs include DPA holders, court-appointed legal guardians, or parents or siblings over 18 years of age. We will consult with the Human Subjects Protection Unit as necessary.

","
Confirmed chromosomal diagnosis of Down syndrome.
Age at entry into the study is 30 years or under. This upper age limit at study entry is being implemented for the Down syndrome group for several reasons. First, much of the research using magnetic resonance imaging with this population is focused on (older) adult populations and in particular the transition to early onset Alzheimer s disease. Because most (if not all) individuals with Down syndrome demonstrate some brain pathology consistent with Alzheimer s disease by age 30 (e.g., plaques and tangles; Mann & Esiri, 1989), we would like to enroll participants who are 30 years of age and under. Second, studying children and young adults with Down syndrome fills a significant gap in the literature, as there are very few structural magnetic resonance imaging studies of children and young adults with Down syndrome reported in the literature to date, and the majority of these studies are characterized by small samples of convenience (i.e., clinic populations). Thus, there is still a need to describe the developmental course of this disorder from early childhood to young adulthood. Such developmental research may help shed light on the causes of intellectual disability in Down syndrome and also identify individuals with the syndrome who are most at risk for experiencing the cognitive decline that is reported in the literature for some individuals after the age of 30 (Oliver et al., 1998).

Patients with a physician-confirmed diagnosis of ADHD per Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) criteria and the health care practitioner (HCP) has made the decision to prescribe an extended-release methylphenidate (ER MPH) product to the patient for potential improvement of symptoms throughout and later in the day, independent of this study.
Patient must be 12 years of age or older.
Patient must be eligible to receive Adhansia XR or osmotic- release oral delivery system methylphenidate ([OROS MPH] or Concerta) according to the US product labels; a patient must be eligible and willing to receive either drug, as randomization will assign them to a specific treatment group. Patient may be treatment-experienced or naïve to pharmacological therapy for ADHD, so long as all inclusion and no exclusion criteria are met.
Patient must be willing to take only the assigned study medication per HCP instructions based on FDA label guidance for treatment of their ADHD for the first 2 months of the study (i.e. full titration period). Patients should not be on any other medication, or starting any new non-medication treatment, proven to have effect on ADHD in the first two months of the study.
","
Concurrent participation in an investigational study in which patient assessment and/or treatment may be dictated by a protocol.
Patients with a true allergy to methylphenidate (MPH), amphetamine (AMP), or sympathomimetic amines, history of serious adverse reactions to MPH or AMP or be known to be non-responsive to MPH or AMP treatment.
Patient is currently stable on their ADHD treatment regimen.
Female patients of child bearing potential who are pregnant, planning on becoming pregnant or breastfeeding.
Patient with any known conditions that are contraindicated for either Adhansia XR or OROS MPH (or Concerta) use, as documented in the US Full Prescribing Information, including patients with any known serious structural cardiac abnormalities, cardiomyopathy, serious heart arrhythmias, or coronary artery disease.
Patients with a known sensitivity to the food dye tartrazine (Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Yellow No. 5).

Suicidal Ideation

The Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) will be administered at screening and at Month-2, Month-4, and Month-6, but also depends on the judgment of the HCP.

Additionally, it is permissible for potential participants to have received investigational or off-label agents for COVID-19 prior to or during study participation.
Pregnant or breastfeeding women are excluded from this study because NT-I7 has not been evaluated regarding its potential for teratogenic or abortifacients effects. There is a potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with the study drug; therefore, breastfeeding should be discontinued if the mother is treated with NT-I7.

4.1.5 Age >18 years and less than 65.
4.1.6 Ability to complete evaluation surveys in English.

4.1.7 The effects of oxaloacetate on the developing human fetus at the recommended therapeutic dose are unknown. For this reason, women of childbearing potential must agree to use adequate contraception (barrier method of birth control; IUD; abstinence) prior to study entry and for the duration of study participation. Women of any age who have had their ovaries and/or uterus removed will not be at risk for pregnancy and will not require contraception. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while participating in this study, she should inform her study physician immediately.

Menopausal status will be established as follows: Women who are 55 years or older and who are not menstruating will be considered postmenopausal and not at risk for pregnancy. Women who are less than 55 years old who are menstruating will be considered premenopausal and will require contraception. Women who are less than 55 years with an intact uterus and ovaries who are not menstruating and have not had a menstrual period within the past 2 years will have an FSH and estradiol measured. If the values are in postmenopausal range the woman will be considered postmenopausal and she will not be considered at risk for pregnancy.

4.2.3 Participants may not be receiving any other investigational agents.
4.2.4 History of allergic reactions attributed to compounds of similar chemical or biologic composition to oxaloacetate.
4.2.5 Uncontrolled intercurrent illness including, but not limited to, ongoing or active infection of Covid-19 or other virus, symptomatic congestive heart failure, unstable angina pectoris, cardiac arrhythmia, or psychiatric illness/social situations that would limit compliance with study requirements.
4.2.6 Pregnant or breast-feeding women are excluded from this study because the safety of oxaloacetate in this setting is unknown. A pregnancy test will be performed on all women with an intact uterus and ovaries who are not determined to be postmenopausal, as described in section 4.1.7.

Ability to understand and the willingness to sign a written informed consent. Adults not competent to consent will be enrolled with the use of an appropriate legally authorized representative (per California Code, Health and Safety Code - HSC)

FDA regulations generally require that the informed consent of a participant be documented by the use of a written consent form approved by the IRB and signed and dated by the participant or the participant's legally authorized representative at the time of consent (21 case form report [CFR] 50.27[a]). In light of COVID-19 infection control measures, the following procedure would satisfy documentation of this requirement if the participant signing the informed consent is in COVID-19 isolation. If the technology is available, electronic methods of obtaining informed consent will be taken. The electronic consent and Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA) forms will be uploaded and available through REDCap

No use of disallowed medications prior to randomization: Remdesivir or whatever drug may have been approved as standard of care to treat COVID patients. After consenting and randomization, patient could get remdesivir and/or other approved standard of care treatments on the standard of care arm as physician's choice. However, they would not be allowed to receive this on the radiotherapy arm until interim analysis is completed (i.e., after the first 8 patients enrolled on both arms with at least 14 day follow-up. This would especially be the case, if we see a vast superiority of one arm over another for the primary endpoints, that puts patients at risks from obtaining the standard of care treatments) However, patient could recieve such therapy if they are mechanically ventilated.

Therefore, concomitant use of strong inhibitors of CYP3A4 (e.g., ketoconazole, itraconazole, clarithromycin, indinavir, nelfinavir and saquinavir), and inducers of CYP3A (e.g. rifampin, phenytoin, carbamazepine, phenobarbital, St. John's wort) are not permitted. The use of other herbals will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis. If they are deemed to be strong modulators of CYP3A4, patients will be excluded if they are unable or unwilling to stop taking them
Women who plan to breast feed while on this study are not eligible for participation due to the potential for unnecessary adverse event risks to a child

The effects of duvelisib on the developing human fetus are unknown. For this reason, women of child-bearing potential (WOCBP) must have a negative serum or urine pr5egnancy test prior to starting therapy. WOCBP and men must agree to use adequate contraception (hormonal or barrier method of birth control; abstinence) from enrollment into this study until at least 60 days after the first dose of duvelisib. A woman of childbearing potential (WOCBP) is a sexually mature woman who: 1) has not undergone a hysterectomy or bilateral oophorectomy; or 2) has not been naturally postmenopausal for at least 24 consecutive months (i.e., has had menses at any time in the preceding 24 consecutive months. Should a woman become pregnant or suspect she is pregnant while she or her partner is participating in this study, she should inform her treating physician immediately. Men treated or enrolled on this protocol must also agree to use adequate contraception prior to the study, for the duration of study participation, and 2 months after completion of duvelisib administration. WOCBP must have a negative pregnancy test within 24 hours of the first dose of duvelisib.

The patient must be willing to comply with fertility requirements as below:

Total abstinence (when this is in line with the usual practice and lifestyle of the patient) will be accepted. Periodic abstinence (i.e., calendar, ovulation, post-ovulation methods) and withdrawals are not acceptable forms

If a female participant is of reproductive potential, the participant (and her partner) must agree to use of one of the following combinations of birth control during the study and for 2 months after the last dose of study drug (or tubal ligation as a single method):

Use of a double-barrier method of contraception: condoms (male or female) and a diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide;
Use of an IUD and a barrier method: condoms (male or female, with or without spermicide) or a diaphragm or cervical cap with spermicide;
Tubal ligation.


Women who are post-menopausal, defined as age greater than 45 and no menses for at least 24 consecutive months, or who have had a hysterectomy, are considered not of reproductive potential.
Males must agree to using contraception during the study and for 2 months after the last dose of study drug or have undergone a male sterilization procedure (at least 6 months prior to screening.
Use of oral (estrogen and progesterone), injected or implanted hormonal methods of contraception, or placement of an intrauterine device (IUD) or intrauterine system (IUS) or other forms of contraception that comparable efficacy (failure rate <1%). In case of oral contraception, the woman should be stable on the same pill for a minimum of 3 months prior to enrollment on the study.


Patients must agree not to donate blood, sperm/ova or any other organs while taking protocol therapy and for at least 2 weeks after stopping treatment.
Willingness and ability of the patient to comply with scheduled visits, drug administration plan, protocol specified laboratory tests, other study procedures and study restrictions
Evidence of personally signed informed consent indicating that the subject is aware of the life-threatening nature of the disease and has been informed on the procedures to be followed, the experimental nature of the therapy, alternative, potential risks and discomforts, potential benefits and other pertinent aspects of study participation.

Patients requiring mechanical ventilation (intubation or Bi-PAP) at the time randomization.
Patients receiving any investigational drugs other than drugs or therapies to treat COVID-19, with the exception of investigational immune-modulatory drugs as per section 5.4.
Pregnant women are excluded from this study because duvelisib is agent with the potential for teratogenic or abortifacient effects. Because there is an unknown but potential risk for adverse events in nursing infants secondary to treatment of the mother with duvelisib, breastfeeding should be discontinued before starting study drug and breastfeeding should not be resumed until at least 1 month after last dose of study drug.
Clinical suspicion that the etiology of acute illness (acute decompensation) is primarily due to a condition other than COVID-19
Known contraindication to duvelisib

Individuals who are younger than 18 years old or who does not have diagnosis of ASD will excluded from the study as the purpose of the current research is to evaluate the validity of ESPs in adults with autism.
Adults who are unable to understand English will be excluded because the instruments being investigated are currently only validated in English and the study team is not sufficiently fluent in other languages to provide assurance that informed consent could be obtained (or intervention provided) in a language besides English.
Subjects without access to a compatible iOS and Android smartphone (nearly all phones from the past 10 years are compatible) will be excluded because the study requires subjects to record responses on a smartphone app. Individuals will not be excluded from the study based on race, ethnicity or gender.
Subjects who have a verbal IQ below 70 will be excluded as this is a study that requires self-report and engagement in a one-on-one intervention.

Reliable contraception is defined as a method which results in a low failure rate, i.e., less than 1% per year when used consistently and correctly, such as hormonal contraception (oral, implant, injection, ring, or patch) and intrauterine contraceptive devices (IUDs) at least 3 months prior to Screening or a vasectomized partner. Note: Complete abstinence from sexual intercourse is acceptable.
Female subject is of non-childbearing potential defined as surgically sterile (i.e. documented bilateral tubal ligation, bilateral oophorectomy, or complete hysterectomy) or at least 12 months postmenopausal (defined with no menses without an alternative medical cause and follicle stimulating hormone test in the post-menopausal range at the screening visit.
Male subjects with partners of childbearing potential must have had surgical sterilization (vasectomy) at least 26 weeks prior to screening or use a male barrier method of contraception (i.e. male condom with spermicide) during any sexual intercourse, from Study Day -1 (beginning of confinement) until 3 months after the final Follow-up Visit on Day 270. Note: complete abstinence from sexual intercourse is acceptable.
Male subjects must agree to abstain from sperm donation from initial study drug administration through 3 months after the last Follow-up Visit on Day 180.

Hospitalization for any reason within 60 days prior to the screening visit
History of or positive human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) screen result, or positive blood test for hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) or hepatitis B core antibody (HBcAb). Subjects with positive hepatitis C virus (HCV) antibody at the screening visit are only eligible if they have previously completed treatment for HCV and have confirmatory negative test for HCV RNA.
History of drug or alcohol abuse within 1 year prior to screening, or positive test for drugs of potential abuse at screening and admission, where alcohol abuse is defined as regular consumption exceeding 7 drinks/ week for women, and 14 drinks/ week for men.
Participation (defined as receipt of dose of investigational agent) in any clinical research study evaluating another investigational drug or therapy within 30 days or at least 5 half-lives (whichever is longer), of the investigational drug prior to the screening visit
Blood donation of approximately 1 pint (500 mL) within 60 days prior to dosing, or donation of more than 1 unit of plasma within 30 days prior to the start of study drug dosing
Receipt of any transfused blood products within 60 days of the screening visit.
Any history of receiving treatment or vaccination against SARS-CoV-2
Febrile illness within 28 days prior to the first dose of study drug, or other signs or symptoms consistent with SARS-CoV-2 infection in the judgement of the Investigator in the 14 days prior to the first dose of study drug.

As determined by medical history and physical examination to evaluate acute or ongoing chronic medical diagnoses/conditions that have been present for at least 90 days, which would affect the assessment of safety of subjects. Chronic medical diagnoses/conditions should be stable for the last 60 days (no hospitalizations, emergency room (ER), or urgent care for condition or need for supplemental oxygen). This includes no change in chronic prescription medication, dose, or frequency as a result of deterioration of the chronic medical diagnosis/condition in the 60 days before enrollment. Any prescription change that is due to change of health care provider, insurance company, etc., or done for financial reasons, and in the same class of medication, will not be considered a deviation of this inclusion criterion. Any change in prescription medication due to improvement of a disease outcome, as determined by the participating site principal investigator (PI) or appropriate sub-investigator, will not be considered a deviation of this inclusion criterion. Subjects may be on chronic or as needed (prn) medications if, in the opinion of the participating site PI or appropriate sub-investigator, they pose no additional risk to subject safety or assessment of reactogenicity and immunogenicity, and do not indicate a worsening of medical diagnosis/condition. Similarly, medication changes subsequent to enrollment and study vaccination are acceptable provided the change was not precipitated by deterioration in the chronic medical condition, and there is no anticipated additional risk to the subject or interference with the evaluation of responses to study vaccination.
